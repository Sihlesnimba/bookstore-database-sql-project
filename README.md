# 📚 Bookstore Database Project (MySQL)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is part of our Database Design & Programming with SQL coursework. It involves designing and implementing a relational database system using MySQL for a fictional bookstore. The system manages books, authors, customers, orders, shipping, and more.

As a team of three, we collaborated to design the schema, write SQL scripts, create user roles, and run queries for data analysis.
